**Last Updated:** 2025-11-05

## Executive Summary

Basin has sent **16 campaigns** between Aug 9 - Nov 4, 2025 to an audience of ~2,450-2,500 subscribers.

**KEY FINDINGS:**
- ✅ **Strong open rates:** 37-61% (industry average: 21-25%)
- ❌ **Critical problem: Very low click-through rates:** 0-1.89% (industry average: 2-5%)
- ❌ **No automated email sequences** (0 automations configured)
- ❌ **Inconsistent CTAs:** Many emails lack actionable links

**Root Cause:** Most emails are informational rather than action-oriented. Even when opened enthusiastically, subscribers have nowhere to go.

## Audience Insights

### List Growth
- **Current size:** ~2,450-2,500 subscribers
- **Growth rate:** Relatively stable (37 new subscribers over 39 days tracked)
- **Churn:** Low unsubscribe rates (4-12 per campaign = 0.2-0.5%)

- **High trust:** Low spam reports (0-1 per campaign)

### Segmentation Opportunities (Currently Not Used)
Basin is sending **one-size-fits-all broadcasts** to entire list. No segmentation detected.

**Recommended segments based on available data:**
1. **Active Members** (387 in Capitan association) - Different messaging than prospects
2. **Student Segment** (Baylor, MCC, TSTC, Temple - 57 total) - Student-specific offers
3. **Founders Team** (86 members) - Exclusive updates, ask for referrals
4. **Birthday Party Attendees** (511) - Convert kids' parents to members
5. **Lapsed Members** (canceled in past 90 days) - Win-back campaigns
6. **Event Participants** (from Capitan events) - Promote next event
7. **High-Value Customers** (Annual members, class purchasers) - VIP treatment
8. **Never Purchased** (on email list but no Capitan transactions) - Onboarding series

---

## Key Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes (Quick Wins)

1. **Add CTAs to Informational Emails**
   - "This Week at Basin" newsletter needs booking links for every event mentioned
   - Even facility updates should include "Book a Visit" or "View Schedule" CTA

2. **Standardize CTA Strategy**
   - Every email should have 1-2 clear, action-oriented CTAs
   - Link directly to Capitan booking pages, not Mailchimp landing pages
   - Use button format, not just text links

3. **Set Up Basic Automations (Start with 3)**
   - Welcome series for new subscribers
   - New member onboarding
   - Event registration reminders

### Medium-Term Improvements (30-60 days)

4. **Implement Segmentation**
   - Start with Active Members vs Non-Members
   - Different messaging drives better conversion

5. **Create Email Template Library**
   - Event promotion template (clear CTA format)
   - Class announcement template
   - Member update template
   - All should have consistent CTA placement and design

6. **A/B Test Subject Lines**
   - Test emoji vs no emoji
   - Test urgency ("Last Chance" vs "Don't Miss")
   - Test specificity ("Boulder Bash This Saturday" vs "Upcoming Competition")

### Long-Term Strategy (90+ days)

7. **Behavioral Automation Flows**
   - Cart abandonment (started class registration but didn't complete)
   - Post-visit follow-up (checked in via Capitan)
   - Milestone celebrations (50 check-ins, 6-month member anniversary)

8. **Content Calendar Integration**
   - Sync with Instagram posting schedule
   - Coordinate email themes with in-gym promotions
   - Plan seasonal campaigns in advance

9. **Advanced Segmentation**
   - Climbing level (beginner vs advanced)
   - Interest-based (fitness vs climbing vs kids programs)
   - Engagement tier (super fans vs casual)
   - Geographic (if expanding locations)
