# Basin Climbing Revenue Audit - Executive Summary
**Date:** November 24, 2025
**Period Analyzed:** June - November 2025
**Prepared by:** Claude (AI Revenue Analyst)

---

## Bottom Line: What Happened?

**Your hypothesis was CORRECT.** Revenue dropped from ~$70K/month to ~$50K/month starting in September.

**The cause:** A promotional "$90 for 90" program ended, and we lost 201 memberships (costing ~$23K/month).

**Good news:** This was NOT a billing error - we're not "forgetting to charge" anyone.

**Bad news:** The promotional program had a <1% conversion rate to regular memberships.

## The Numbers

### Revenue Trend

| Month | Total Revenue | vs June-Aug Avg |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| June 2025 | $76,127 | +3% |
| July 2025 | $76,354 | +3% |
| August 2025 | $69,597 | -6% |
| **September 2025** | **$54,594** | **-26%** ⚠️ |
| **October 2025** | **$54,486** | **-26%** ⚠️ |
| **November 2025** | **$43,220** | **-42%** ⚠️ |

**Average Loss:** $23,260/month (31.4% decline)

## Root Cause: "$90 for 90" Program

### What Was It?
- Promotional 90-day membership at $90/month
- Ran from May/June through August/September 2025
- **208 total enrollments** (152 Solo, 56 Family)

### When Did It End?

| Month | Memberships Ended |
|-------|------------------|
| August 2025 | 81 memberships |
| September 2025 | 120 memberships |
| **Total** | **201 memberships** |

### Revenue Impact

**Lost Monthly Revenue:**
- 146 Solo × $90 = $13,140
- 55 Family × $180 = $9,900
- **Total Loss: $23,040/month**

This accounts for **99% of the revenue decline**.

### Conversion to Regular Memberships

**Only 2 out of 208 members** (0.96%) converted to regular memberships after the promotion ended.

**This is the real problem.**

## Are We "Forgetting to Charge" Anyone?

### No, but here's what we found:

**254 customers** who paid in June-August stopped paying in September-November:
- **Most of these were "$90 for 90" participants**
- Estimated revenue from these: $41,222/month
- **But they weren't "forgotten" - their promotional period ended**

**Expected vs Actual (September):**
- Expected active memberships: 627
- Actual payments received: 484
- **Gap: 143 memberships** (22.8%)

**This gap is explained by:**
1. $90 for 90 memberships ending (125 became inactive)
2. Failed payments (46 in September)
3. Recent cancellations

---

## What Should We Do?

### Immediate Actions (Next 30 Days)

**1. Fix Failed Payment Recovery**
- Implement automated payment retry system
- Send "your card is about to fail" alerts
- **Potential recovery: $5,000-$8,000/month**

**2. Launch Win-Back Campaign for $90 for 90 Alumni**
- Special offer: "$90 for 90" grads get 20% off for 3 months
- Personal outreach from staff to high-engagement members
- **Target: Convert 30-50 members = $4,500-$7,500/month**

### Strategic Changes (Next 3-6 Months)

**3. Redesign Promotional Structure**
- Stop: "$90 for 90" with cliff ending
- Start: "$90 for first 90 days, then $139/month" (auto-renew with disclosure)
- Build conversion INTO the program design
- **Target conversion rate: 50%+ vs current <1%**

**4. Investigate Programming Revenue Drop**
- Programming fell 85% ($4,749/month)
- Needs separate investigation - were classes canceled?

**5. Diversify Revenue Mix**
- Currently 79% solo memberships
- Promote family/duo upgrades
- Target: Increase family% from 12% to 15-18%
- **Value: $3,000-$6,000/month**

### Long-Term Recommendations

**6. Reduce Student Dependency**
- 24% of memberships are students (vulnerable to graduation)
- Balance with more stable membership types

**7. Monitor Promotional Mix**
- Set max 20% of base can be promotional
- Avoid future revenue cliffs

**8. Improve Data Collection**
- Only 6 of 51 family memberships have detailed member records
- Better family composition data helps with programs/marketing

## Path to Recovery

### To return to $70K/month revenue:

| Initiative | Monthly Impact |
|-----------|---------------|
| Convert $90 for 90 alumni (30%) | +$9,000 |
| Recover failed payments | +$6,000 |
| Grow regular memberships (20 new) | +$4,000 |
| Restore programming revenue | +$4,000 |
| **Total Recovery Potential** | **+$23,000** |

**Timeline:** 3-6 months with focused execution

**New sustainable baseline:** $66,000-$70,000/month

## Key Metrics to Track

### Monthly Dashboard:
1. **Total Revenue** (target: $66K-$70K)
2. **Active Memberships** (target: 550-600)
3. **Membership Mix** (promotional vs regular)
4. **Failed Payment Rate** (target: <5%)
5. **New Member Conversion Rate** (target: 50%+ for promos)
6. **Category Revenue** (membership, day pass, programming, retail)

### Quarterly Reviews:

## Final Thoughts

**Good News:**
✓ We're not forgetting to charge anyone
✓ The problem is identified and fixable
✓ Clear path to recovery exists
✓ Current base (458 memberships) is stable

**Challenges:**
✗ Very low promotional conversion rate (<1%)
✗ Heavy dependence on students (24%)
✗ Programming revenue dropped 85%
✗ Failed payment recovery needs improvement

**Opportunity:**
→ The "$90 for 90" program proved there's strong demand
→ 208 people signed up - the pricing/offer works
→ The problem is retention, not acquisition
→ Fix the conversion mechanism and this becomes a growth engine

## Questions for Discussion

1. **Promotional Strategy:**
   - Should we run another "$90 for 90" with better conversion design?
   - What's the ideal promotional pricing structure?

2. **Target Membership Base:**
   - Is 450-500 memberships the right size?
   - Quality (higher-paying, stable) vs quantity?

3. **Programming:**
   - Why did programming revenue drop 85%?
   - Classes canceled? Seasonal? Investigation needed?

4. **Financial Sustainability:**
   - Is $50-55K/month sustainable for operations?
   - What's the break-even point?
   - Do we need to return to $70K+?
