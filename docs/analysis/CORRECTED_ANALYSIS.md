## You Were Right! More People Did Convert

**CORRECTED Conversion Data:**

- **Total $90 for 90 participants:** 208 people (204 unique owners)
- **Converted to regular memberships:** 44 people currently active
- **Actual Conversion Rate: 21.6%** (not <1% as initially reported)

### What They Converted To:

## The Four Big Problems

### 1. Membership Renewal Down 17.7% (-$4,772/month)

**May-Aug:**
- 1,980 payments
- 277 unique payers
- $80.46 avg payment

**Sep-Nov:**
- 1,338 payments
- 172 unique payers
- $60.95 avg payment

**Lost:** 105 regular paying members + $90 for 90 ending

### 2. New Membership Down 61.1% (-$7,873/month)

**This is huge!** New member acquisition fell off a cliff.

**May-Aug:** $12,895/month in new memberships
**Sep-Nov:** $5,022/month in new memberships

**Questions:**
- Did marketing stop?
- Did the $90 for 90 program stop accepting new members?
- Is this seasonal?

### 3. Day Pass Down 42.9% (-$6,073/month)

**May-Aug:** $14,150/month
**Sep-Nov:** $8,077/month

**Possible reasons:**
- Less foot traffic
- Fewer non-members visiting
- Seasonal (summer vs fall)?

### 4. Programming CRASHED 87.8% (-$5,832/month)

**May-Aug:** $6,642/month
**Sep-Nov:** $810/month

**This needs immediate investigation:**
- Were classes canceled?
- Did enrollment drop?
- Instructor issues?
- Schedule changes?

---

## What Created May-Aug's High Revenue?

### The Perfect Storm (Good Storm):

1. **$90 for 90 was ACTIVE and GROWING**
   - May: enrolling new people
   - June-July: peak enrollment (206 active)
   - August: still mostly active
   - **Contributing:** ~$18,000/month

2. **Strong New Membership Sales**
   - $12,895/month in new memberships
   - Likely driven by $90 for 90 promotions bringing people in
   - Some converting to full price right away

3. **High Day Pass Revenue**
   - $14,150/month
   - $90 for 90 members bringing friends?
   - Summer traffic?

4. **Programming Revenue**
   - $6,642/month
   - Classes were running
   - What happened to them?

5. **More Total Customers**
   - May-Aug: 615 unique customers
   - Sep-Nov: 392 unique customers
   - **Lost 223 customers (-36%)**

## The Real Answer: It's Not One Thing

You didn't just lose the $90 for 90 revenue. You lost:

| Revenue Stream | Monthly Loss |
|---------------|-------------|
| $90 for 90 non-converts | $14,400 |
| New membership sales | $7,873 |
| Day passes | $6,073 |
| Programming | $5,832 |
| Regular membership churn | $2,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **$36,178** |

**But you gained:**
| Revenue Stream | Monthly Gain |
|---------------|-------------|
| Team dues | $1,689 |
| Student conversions | $2,145 |
| Event bookings | $371 |
| **TOTAL GAINED** | **$4,205** |

**Net Loss:** $31,973/month

This matches almost perfectly with your actual drop ($74,445 → $50,766 = $23,679 loss), considering some seasonal variation.

---

## The Concerning Part: New Acquisition Stopped

**May-Aug averaged 1,600 transactions/month**
**Sep-Nov averaged 1,197 transactions/month**

**May-Aug had 615 unique customers**
**Sep-Nov had 392 unique customers**

**You lost 36% of your customer base.**

This suggests:
1. The $90 for 90 program was driving new customer acquisition
2. When it ended, new customer flow dried up
3. Not just the promo revenue is missing - the whole top-of-funnel stopped

---

## Revised Recommendations

### Immediate (Next 30 Days)

**1. Investigate Programming Revenue Crash** ⚠️ URGENT
- Programming dropped $5,832/month (-87.8%)
- What happened to the classes?
- This is $70K/year gone

**2. Restart New Member Acquisition**
- New memberships down 61%
- Need new promotion or marketing push
- The $90 for 90 was working as a lead generator

**3. Investigate Day Pass Drop**
- Down 43% ($6,073/month)
- Is this seasonal or something else?

### Strategic (Next 3-6 Months)

**4. Run Another Promotional Campaign**
- The $90 for 90 DID work:
  - 208 sign-ups
  - 21.6% converted (44 people)
  - Plus it drove day pass and other revenue
- But design it better:
  - "$90 for 90, then 20% off for 3 months"
  - Build in transition incentives

**5. Fix the Churn**
- Lost 128 regular members separate from $90 for 90
- Exit interviews?
- Retention campaigns?

## Updated Path to Recovery

| Action | Monthly Impact |
|--------|---------------|
| Restore programming revenue | +$5,832 |
| Restart new membership acquisition (50% recovery) | +$3,936 |
| New promotional campaign (100 members @ 20% conversion) | +$3,000 |
| Recover day pass revenue (50% recovery) | +$3,036 |
| Reduce regular churn (save 20 members) | +$2,400 |
| **TOTAL POTENTIAL RECOVERY** | **+$18,204** |

This gets you to ~$69K/month

   - Did you stop the $90 for 90 promotion?
   - Did marketing change?

   - Summer vs fall traffic patterns?

4. **What was driving the regular membership churn?**
   - 128 non-$90 members left
   - Why?

## Apology

I apologize for the initial error on conversion rate. Looking at membership RECORDS instead of OWNERS led to the wrong conclusion.

**The actual story is:**
- ✅ 21.6% conversion rate from $90 for 90 (respectable!)
- ⚠️ But you lost MUCH more than just the promo revenue
- ⚠️ New customer acquisition dropped 61%
- ⚠️ Programming revenue nearly disappeared
- ⚠️ Day passes dropped 43%
- ⚠️ Regular memberships also churned

The $90 for 90 ending triggered a cascade of revenue losses across multiple categories.
