## Family Membership Composition

### Overall Family Stats

- **Total Family Memberships:** 51
- **Family Types:**
  - Family Weekly: 15
  - Family Annual: 14
  - Mid Day Membership - Family: 4
  - BCF Owner Family: 13

### People per Family (Sample of 6 families with detailed records)

**Note:** Only 6 family memberships have detailed individual member records in the system.

| # People per Family | # Families | % |
|---------------------|-----------|-----|
| 2 people | 1 | 16.7% |
| 13 people | 1 | 16.7% |
| 14 people | 1 | 16.7% |
| 16 people | 1 | 16.7% |
| 38 people | 1 | 16.7% |
| 52 people | 1 | 16.7% |

**Average:** 22.5 people per family membership (from this sample)

**Important Note:** These 6 families appear to be special cases (BCF staff families, team dues, etc.) and are not representative of typical family memberships. Most regular family memberships likely have 2-4 people.

### Kids vs Adults (in families with data)

From 5 families with age data:

- **Kids (under 18):** 48 people (49.0%)
- **Adults (18+):** 50 people (51.0%)
- **Average kids per family:** 9.6 kids
- **Families with kids:** 100%

**Distribution of Kids:**
- 2 kids: 1 family (20%)
- 8 kids: 2 families (40%)
- 10 kids: 1 family (20%)
- 20 kids: 1 family (20%)

**Note:** These are clearly special group/team memberships, not typical family subscriptions. A typical family membership likely has 2-3 kids.

## Revenue Implications

### By Frequency (estimated monthly revenue rates)

Assuming average rates:
- Solo Weekly: ~$33/week = $143/month
- Solo Monthly: ~$150/month
- Solo Annual: ~$1,400/year = $117/month
- College Student: ~$90/month
- Regular Student: ~$65/month
- Duo: ~$200-250/month
- Family: ~$275-300/month

### Rough Revenue Breakdown:

**Solo Memberships (346):**
- Weekly (155): 155 × $143 = $22,165/month
- Monthly (148): 148 × $150 = $22,200/month
- Annual (36): 36 × $117 = $4,212/month
- **Solo Subtotal: ~$48,577/month**

**Student Memberships (104):**
- College (71): 71 × $90 = $6,390/month
- Regular (33): 33 × $65 = $2,145/month
- **Student Subtotal: ~$8,535/month**

**Duo Memberships (38):**
- 38 × $225 = **~$8,550/month**

**Family Memberships (51):**
- 51 × $285 = **~$14,535/month**

**Staff/BCF (54):**
- Likely discounted/free: **~$0-2,000/month**

**Youth Teams (30):**
- 30 × $50 = **~$1,500/month**

**Fitness Only (10):**
- 10 × $100 = **~$1,000/month**

**Founders (Various):**
- Special rates: **~$2,000/month**

### Estimated Total Membership Revenue: ~$85,000-$87,000/month

**Note:** This is higher than current actual revenue ($43K in Nov) because:
1. Failed payments reduce actual collections
2. Some accounts may be paused/frozen
3. Promotional rates are lower than standard rates
4. November is a partial month

## Comparison to Revenue Audit Findings

From the revenue audit, we saw:
- **September 2025:** $31,403 membership revenue (484 payments, 147 unique payers)
- **October 2025:** $26,869 membership revenue (477 payments, 135 unique payers)
- **November 2025:** $23,272 membership revenue (377 payments, 121 unique payers)

With 436 active memberships but only ~120-150 payers per month, this suggests:
- **Collection rate: ~28-34%** of memberships pay in any given month
- This makes sense for:
  - Annual memberships (only pay once/year)
  - Bi-weekly memberships (pay every 2 weeks, not monthly)
  - Failed payments
  - Paused/frozen accounts

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Membership Mix:** Heavy on Solo (79%) and Students (24%), lighter on Family (12%) and Duo (9%)

2. **Payment Timing:** 50% bi-weekly means revenue is spread throughout the month, not concentrated

3. **Student Dependence:** Nearly 1 in 4 memberships are students - vulnerable to graduation/semester changes

4. **Internal Memberships:** 12% are staff/BCF - these are likely discounted/free

5. **Family Data Limited:** Only 6 of 51 family memberships have detailed member records - data collection opportunity

6. **Opportunity:** Converting more Solo members to Family/Duo could increase average revenue per membership
