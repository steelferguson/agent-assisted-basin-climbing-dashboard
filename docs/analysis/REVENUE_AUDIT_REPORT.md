## 2. The "$90 for 90" Program - Primary Cause

## 8. Customers Who Stopped Paying

**254 customers** who paid regularly in June-August stopped paying in September-November.

**Estimated Monthly Revenue Loss from these customers:** $41,222.38

### Top 20 Customers Who Stopped Paying (by average payment amount):

| Rank | Customer Name | Avg Payment | Payment Count |
|------|--------------|------------|---------------|
| 1 | Heather Fletcher | $3,822.09 | 1 |
| 2 | Private Event Rental - Remaining Balance | $1,310.06 | 1 |
| 3 | Laura Alvarez | $1,012.14 | 1 |
| 4 | Robert Tipps | $1,012.14 | 1 |
| 5 | Elizabeth Barton | $977.93 | 2 |
| 6 | Jeff Hookham | $930.95 | 1 |
| 7-13 | Various high-value customers | $855.18 each | 1 each |

**Many of these appear to be "$90 for 90" participants** based on payment amounts (~$855 = 3 months of family membership upfront).

---

## 9. Expected vs Actual September Payments

**Expected Active Memberships (September):** 627
**Actual Membership Payments Received:** 484
**Unique Payers:** 147

**Gap:** 143 memberships did not result in payments (22.8% non-payment rate)

This is likely due to:
1. $90 for 90 memberships ending (125 became inactive)
2. Failed payments (46 failures in September)
3. Cancellations without proper end dates

---

## Conclusions

### Hypothesis: TRUE

Revenue did drop from ~$70K/month to ~$50-55K/month starting in September 2025.

### Are We "Forgetting to Charge Someone"?

**No, we are not forgetting to charge anyone.**

The revenue decline is due to a **planned promotional program ending** rather than a billing error:

1. **Primary Cause (99%):** The "$90 for 90" promotional program ended after 90 days
   - 201 memberships ended between August-September 2025
   - These were **intentionally time-limited promotional memberships**
   - Revenue loss: ~$23,000/month

2. **Secondary Factor:** Low conversion from promotional to regular memberships
   - Only 2 out of 206 "$90 for 90" members remain active as of November
   - Conversion rate: **<1%**

---

## Recommendations

### 1. **Immediate: Improve Promotional Conversion Rate**

The "$90 for 90" program had excellent enrollment (208 members) but terrible conversion (<1%).

**Actions:**
- Implement conversion nurturing campaign in final 30 days of promotional memberships
- Offer transition incentive (e.g., "$90 for 90" members get 10% off regular membership for 3 months)
- Personal outreach from staff to high-engagement promotional members
- Create automatic email sequence 60/30/14/7 days before promotion ends

**Potential Impact:** If 30% of promotional members converted, that's **60 members × $150 avg = $9,000/month recovered**

### 2. **Strategic: Revise Promotional Program Structure**

Current approach:
- ✗ Creates revenue cliff when program ends
- ✗ Attracts price-sensitive customers who don't convert
- ✗ No built-in transition mechanism

Suggested structure:
- ✓ "First 90 days at $90, then $139/month thereafter" (auto-renew with discount)
- ✓ Require credit card on file with auto-renewal disclosure
- ✓ Build conversion into the program design, not as an afterthought

**Potential Impact:** 50%+ conversion rate instead of <1%

### 3. **Monitor: Regular vs Promotional Membership Mix**

- Track the ratio of promotional to regular memberships
- Set targets for sustainable membership base (e.g., <20% promotional)
- Avoid over-reliance on promotional pricing

### 4. **Investigate: Programming Revenue Drop**

Programming revenue dropped 85.4% ($4,748/month loss). This needs separate investigation:
- Were programs canceled?
- Did enrollment decline?
- Is this seasonal?

### 5. **Address: Failed Payment Recovery**

46 failed payments in September totaling $8,576:
- Implement automated payment retry system
- Send proactive "your card is about to fail" notices
- Offer payment method update incentive

**Potential Recovery:** $5,000-$8,000/month

## Financial Summary

### Current State (November 2025)
- **Monthly Revenue:** $43,219.52 (partial month)
- **Active Memberships:** 458
- **Trend:** Stabilizing at new lower baseline

### Pre-Drop Baseline (June-August 2025)
- **Monthly Revenue:** $74,025.88 average
- **Active Memberships:** 633-667

### Sustainable Baseline (Excluding Promotional)
- **Monthly Revenue:** ~$51,000-$53,000
- **Active Memberships:** ~450-475 (regular memberships only)
- **This is likely the true "organic" revenue level**

### Path to Recovery

To return to $70K/month revenue **sustainably**:

1. **Convert promotional members:** +$9,000/month (30% conversion)
2. **Recover failed payments:** +$6,000/month (better payment systems)
3. **Grow regular memberships:** +$4,000/month (15-20 new memberships)
4. **Restore programming revenue:** +$4,000/month
5. **Total Recovery Potential:** +$23,000/month

**Timeline:** 3-6 months with focused execution
