## Key Insights

### 1. Solo Visitors Dominate
- **74%** of all day pass purchases are for single individuals
- However, solo visitors only account for **54%** of total passes sold
- This means group visitors (though fewer in number) significantly boost volume

### 2. Pairs Are Significant
- **19%** of transactions are for 2 people
- **28%** of all passes are sold in pairs
- Pairs represent the second-most important customer segment

### 3. Small Groups (3-4) Matter
- **6.4%** of transactions
- **15.2%** of passes sold
- These 264 transactions account for 866 passes

### 4. Large Groups (5+) Are Rare
- Only **30 transactions** with 5+ passes (0.7%)
- But they generated **200 passes** (3.5% of volume)
- Largest group: **13 people** (youth group)

## Youth vs Adult Patterns

### Youth Passes (Under 14)
- **1,337 transactions**
- **Average group size: 1.73** 🎉
- **46.7% are groups** (2+ people)
- Solo: 53.3%

**Youth climbers come in larger groups!** This makes sense - kids often come with siblings, friends, or as part of organized activities.

### Adult Passes (14 and Up)
- **2,599 transactions**
- **Average group size: 1.21**
- **16.8% are groups** (2+ people)

## Business Implications

### Customer Acquisition Focus
The **74% solo visitors** segment is critical for:
- Regular foot traffic
- Potential membership conversions
- Consistent daily revenue

**Current problem:** Transaction volume down 61% (Sep-Nov vs Jan-Feb)
- This affects solo visitors most

### Group Marketing Opportunity
Only **6-7% of transactions are groups of 3+**, but they account for **18.7% of passes sold**.

**Opportunity:** Small increase in group bookings = significant revenue impact

Ideas:
- Group discount (3+ people get 10% off)
- "Bring 3 friends" promotions
- Birthday party packages (already exist but underutilized?)
- Corporate team building events

### Youth Programming
Youth visitors have **1.73 avg group size** vs adults at **1.21**.

**Youth is a group-oriented segment** - families, friends, camps.

Marketing to youth means marketing to parents and group organizers.

### Stable Pattern, Volume Problem
**Group size hasn't changed** - it's been stable around 1.3-1.4 all year.

**The problem is fewer transactions**, not smaller groups.

This confirms the findings from the revenue audit:
- Not a pricing problem
- Not a group-size problem
- **It's a customer acquisition/traffic problem**

---

## Data Notes

- **972 transactions** (23.4%) had missing quantity data
  - These were assumed to be single passes (qty = 1)
  - Most are Capitan entry passes from Square system
  - All appear to be individual purchases based on amounts

---

## Summary

**Who Buys Day Passes:**
- 74% solo climbers (workout, practice, try before membership)
- 19% pairs (couples, friends, climbing partners)
- 7% small groups (3-4 people)
- <1% large groups (5+ people)

**Key Takeaway:**
The typical day pass customer is a **solo adult climber** or a **pair of friends/partners**. Youth customers are more likely to come in groups.

**For Revenue Recovery:**
Focus on **increasing transaction volume** (more solo/pair customers) rather than increasing group sizes, since the group size distribution has remained stable throughout 2025.
