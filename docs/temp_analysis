## 🎯 The Three Core Problems

### Problem #1: Day Pass Revenue Collapsed (BIGGEST)
- **Down 54% from normal** (Jan-Feb → Sep-Oct)
- **Down 43% from high** (May-Aug → Sep-Oct)
- **Loss: $6,000-$10,000/month**
- **Selling 288 fewer passes per month**

**Questions to investigate:**
- Is this seasonal? (Compare to last year Sep-Oct)
- Did marketing stop?
- Competition?
- Are $90 for 90 alumni no longer bringing friends?

### Problem #2: New Member Acquisition Down
- **Down 45% from normal** (Jan-Feb → Sep-Oct)
- **Down 61% from high** (May-Aug → Sep-Oct)
- **Loss: $4,200-$7,900/month**

**The $90 for 90 was your lead generation engine.** When it stopped, new customer flow dropped significantly.

### Problem #3: Programming Revenue Disappeared
- **Down 88% from high** (May-Aug → Sep-Oct)
- **Loss: $5,800/month**

**This needs urgent investigation.** What happened to classes?

## 💡 What's Your "Normal" Revenue?

| Scenario | Monthly Revenue |
|----------|----------------|
| **True Baseline (Jan-Feb)** | **$66,000/mo** |
| With $90 for 90 active (May-Aug) | $74,000/mo |
| Current without day pass recovery (Sep-Oct) | $54,500/mo |
| **Target with improvements** | **$70,000/mo** |

**Your normal baseline without promotions is ~$66K/month.**

May-Aug was artificially high due to $90 for 90. Current state is depressed due to day pass collapse.
